			<h2>What Is It?</h2>
			<p>When you run the <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/extension/">WAVE extension</a> on a page, all this stuff gets added.  The only way to get rid of it is to refresh the page.  This makes the <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/extension/">WAVE extension</a> a pain to use on Single Page Apps.</p>
			<p>The <a class="bookmarkletLink" href="">Low Tide</a> bookmarklet cleans all that up, setting the page back to the way it was before you ran the <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/extension/">WAVE extension</a>.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, one thing it doesn't do is reset the <em>status</em> of the <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/extension/">WAVE extension</a>.  Once you run it, the icon changes colour and a flag gets set as being run.  If you try to run it again, the page refreshes.  So you're kinda screwed if you run it, then run <a class="bookmarkletLink" href="">Low Tide</a>, then need to run WAVE again.</p>
			<h2>How To Use It</h2>
			<p>Just drag the <a class="bookmarkletLink" href="">Low Tide</a> link to your Bookmark toolbar, or add to a Bookmarks folder.  Then after you run the WAVE extension, after you're done with the results, run the Low-Tide bookmarklet.</p>
